Simple Vue.js+Laravel adminpanel to manage directory of companies and their categories/cities.
It is a __Vue version__ of the project that we had done before in Laravel-only way: [directory based on Classimax Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/Laravel-Classimax-Directory).

It is a demo project for demonstrating what can be generated with [Vue.js QuickAdminPanel](https://vue.quickadminpanel.com) tool.
