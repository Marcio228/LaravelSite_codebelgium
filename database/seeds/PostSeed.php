With the rise in competition and also for a business to be profitable, it\'s important that the company should be the leader in innovation and not the follower. For this, there will be a need of software engineers who can actually give life to the owner\'s ideas. If we talk about, robots taking the place of humans, it wouldn\'t be possible without software engineering. For a robot to replace a human and carry out all his tasks and think like one, there has to be certain high ended coding required to be fed into it so that it does exactly what a human does or may be better and more accurate than us.</p><p>Change is constant! The tools, software and hardware won\'t be the same in the coming future. Everything in IT industry keeps improvising. There are certain set of codes needed for this evolving hardware and software to work to its best potential. Also software engineering is something where individuals can bring out their own creation which will be tomorrows trending tool or platform which billions of people will be hooked into.</p><p>Software engineering is a must for IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine learning, to be a success in future. There will be a never ending demand for software engineers globally. According to Forbes, a software engineer who just graduated, his/her median starting salary with no work experience is currently $54,900. There are chances for at least a 60 percent salary growth throughout his or her career. It\'s a thumbs up for individuals thinking to get in or who are already into this field.</p>',

A programmer will develop this skill in the course of their career. As they are constantly exposed to coding day and night, their typing speed increases. A well experienced developer must have repeated the coding and they know what codes are required where and for what. It\'s natural that when we type the same thing repeatedly, the typing speed goes fast as compared to the new things that we type.</p><p>It means that the more a developer has typed codes, the speed of his typing will be fast, hence making him an efficient and experienced developer. Your typing speed is important, if you are a developer. It needs lot of practice, errors, bugs, <a href="https://www.codebelgium.com/courses">fixations</a> and solutions which lands into a right set of codes. And when the same requirement comes, you can just finish it in no time.</p><p>A developer who has a proven typing speed, can also contribute his time in other tasks.

He can also contribute his time in experimenting new things which will benefit the firm or the task he is doing. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;A programmer who types fast can also write quickly his ideas or solve a problem quickly. A slow typing programmer can probably forget some codes which he has thought in first place. New programmers can practice their typing skills by various typing tools and can also practice codes repeatedly. It does not need experience to reach that stage where you will be called a better developer, if this is in your bucket, you are already one. &nbsp;</p>',
